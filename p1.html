    <h1> Workers’ Access to Work-Family Resources</h1><br>

    <p>The goal of this project is to better understand workers’ access to workplace practices and policies that reduce work-family conflict. Due to recent social and economic trends, these resources are becoming increasingly valuable to workers. This is especially true for women as they spend more time caregiving than men and experience greater economic penalties from having children. Because of this, I am especially interested in the prevalence of resources among the types of jobs most often held by women, such as those in teaching, healthcare, and service work.<br><br>
    In this project I focus on three work-family resources: flexible work hours, remote work, and paid family leave.</p><br>

    <h2> Methods </h2><br>
    <p>To address these questions, I merged data from two sources. Workers’ reports of work-family resource (n=10,071) access come from the 2017-2018 American Time Use Survey (collected as part of CPS). These reports are merged with a generated measure of occupational gender composition constructed using weighted frequency counts from a 5-year sample of the American Communities Survey (ACS).</p><br>

    <h2>What types of occupations have the highest and lowest prevalence of work-family resources?</h2><br>
    <p>Figure 1 shows that work-family resource availability is generally highest among STEM, business, and finance occupations. Between 70% and 80% of workers in these occupation groups reported access to flexible work hours and paid family leave, and 55% to 65% reported access to remote work. When looking at individual occupations in Figure 2, access is highest among software developers, lawyers, chief executives, managers, accountants, and sales representatives.<br><br>
    When identifying occupations with low access to work-family resources, trends vary by resource type. Flexible work hours and remote work are generally low in manual labor, education, and healthcare occupations. Elementary and middle school teachers had the lowest prevalence of flexible work hours, with less than 15% reporting this resource. Flexible work hours were also low among registered nurses, production workers, and construction laborers. Servers and housekeepers had the lowest prevalence of remote work, with 0% reporting access. Access to paid family leave varies somewhat, as access is still low among manual labor occupations but is relatively how for education and healthcare occupations, although when examining specific occupations in Figure 2, childcare workers, servers, and cooks reported especially low access to paid family leave. </p><br>

    <h2>How does access to work-family resources vary by occupational gender composition?</h2><br>
    <p>When looking at how work-family resource access varies by occupational gender composition in Figure 3, access in generally highest among occupations with 20-60% female workers, and flexible work hours and remote work are especially rare in occupations with more than 75% females. Figure 4 provides context for which occupations are driving these trends. For male-dominated occupations, manual labor occupations are driving down the prevalence of resources while STEM occupations are increasing prevalences. For female-dominated occupations, office and administrative occupations typically have greater than average access to each resource. Education occupations, however, have especially low access to flexible work hours and remote work. For paid family leave, service occupations also have especially low resource access. </p><br>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Each dot represents an occupation. Only occupations with at least 30 reports of resource access were included. Occupation groupings are ordered from lowest female composition (top) to highest female composition (bottom)</p><br>

    <h2> Conclusions </h2><br>
    <p>Access to resources is generally high in STEM, business, and finance occupations, which are also characterized by a high proportion of male workers. Alternatively, access is low among manual labor occupations, which are also male-dominated, as well as in education and health care occupations, which are female-dominated. This means that overall, occupations that have a higher proportion of female workers typically have low access to work-family resources. This trend is strongest when examining flexible work hours and remote work.<br><br>These findings have three important consequences. First, the findings highlight the wide variability in how work-family resources are distributed to workers. As support grows for policies and workplace norms that are more accommodating to family caregivers, it’s important to keep in mind that different types of work have vastly different relationships with family-friendly work which will continue unless interventions are made. Second, the results indicate that women are least likely to work in occupations that provide family-friendly resources. Because women are often primary family caregivers and face greater penalties than men for caregiving obligations, work-family resources may not be reaching those with the greatest need for resources. As the post-COVID labor market seems to be expanding family-friendly practices, this may primarily affect those in occupations that already have high access to resources, like STEM, expanding differences in access across the labor market. 
    <br><br>Third, in my second project, I examine whether female-dominated work is perceived as being family-friendly among workers. If this is found true and women are making employment decisions based on a need for work-family resources, this could mean women are, in part, going into female-dominated occupations based on an incorrect belief that these types of jobs will provide work-family resources. </p>
